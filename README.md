## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev            # every app; prints the local URL list as they come up
pnpm --filter <app> dev
pnpm dev:stop       # stop every app's dev server
pnpm build          # build every app
```

Each app deploys as its own Cloudflare Worker via git-connected Workers Builds,
with the project's root directory set to `apps/<app>` and build watch paths
scoped so a commit to one app doesn't rebuild the others. App-specific docs
live in each app's README.
